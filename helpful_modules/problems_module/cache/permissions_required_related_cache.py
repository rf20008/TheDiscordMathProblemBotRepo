This is used for permissions required cache
Because there are only a finite amount of permissions needed, this internally uses a JSON file instead of a SQL Database

This uses config.json.

The dict in the permissions_needed key should not be modified.

Also, most of the logic is delegated either to UserDataRequiredCache or AsyncFileReader

Of course, this is licensed under the AGPLv3.
