    A protocol for types that can be converted to and from dictionaries.

    Subclasses must implement the following methods:
    - `from_dict(cls, data: Dict) -> T`: Create an instance from a dictionary.
    - `to_dict(self) -> Dict`: Convert an instance to a dictionary.
    They must be inverse functions.
    More formally, the following constraint should hold for all instances and dictionaries:
    - For every instance `x` such that `isinstance(x,T)` is True, `T.from_dict(x.to_dict()) == x` must hold.
    - For every dictionary `D` such that `T.from_dict(D)` is defined, the following must hold:
        T.from_dict(D).to_dict() == D
    Throw a FormatException if either function is undefined.
